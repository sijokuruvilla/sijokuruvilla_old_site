                      WEQ (Women Entrepreneurship Quest) is a flagship startup competition targeted at early stage founders hosted by Anita Borg Institute supported by DST &amp; IUSSTF. The top 25 will be invited to GHCI conference and 10 winners will be taken on an all expense trip to Silicon Valley. I also happen to be a consultant to this year's edition of WEQ. More details can be availed from their website - <a href="http://bit.ly/WEQ2016" target="_blank">bit.ly/WEQ2016</a>

                      For todayâ€™s live it will be Shanti Mohan. She is the founder &amp; CEO of LetsVenture, an online angel investing platform that has helped over 80 startups raise their angel funding (1Cr to 4Cr range) so far. Our very own iTraveller also managed to raise then 1Mn USD angel round thanks to the support they received from them.

                    <p>
                      One among the most powerful women founders in the Indian startup world now, Shanti has managed to rope in some of the best names in the angel investing world in the country to become investors into her company as well - the likes of Ratan Tata, Nandan Nilekani, Kunal Bahl, Sharad Sharma, Rajan Anandan etc. You can read more about Shanti <a href="http://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/weve-brought-transparency-into-startup-funding-shanti-mohan-letsventure-17464/" target="_blank">here</a>

                    <p>
                      One of the best ways to learn and broaden our perspective is through peer learning - from people who have been there and done that. And these women are some of the most accomplished in their respective domains. Those who nurture entrepreneurial ambitions or is looking to generally understand what is happening in the women startup space, these are the some of the best people that you could possibly connect with. Given that FB Live is also a QnA format, you also get to ask questions. 
                    </p>
