                        This happened sometime during my PGPM days. Idling away the leisure time I was awarded with thanks to the re scheduling of sessions, I came across a book during one of my random visits to the library. The title of the book itself caught my attention and stoked quite a few thoughts in me : The Road Less Travelled.

                    <p>
                        I then proceeded to check out what was the book all about. Interestingly it talked about one of those topics of life about which I have myself spent innumerable hours; thinking, experiencing, practicing and many a time avoiding.

                        “Confronting and solving problems is a painful process which most of us attempt to avoid. And the very avoidance results in greater pain and an inability to grow both mentally and spiritually. Facing our difficulties – and suffering through the changes – can enable us to reach a higher level of self – understanding.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My mind instantly drifted to the words by a fairly renowned Sculpturist, during one of his talks during my high school days: “It is only by pain that birth (creation) happens, it is only by going through the pain of labour that lasting beauty is created.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Didn’t take me much time henceforth to decide to get the book issued. And the person in-charge of issual, not surprisingly, gave me a look as if he is seeing an alien in his territory. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Getting back home I hit the bed with the book in my hand. And the very opening statements made the book a worthy read. And this is how it read. You guys may wanna take a look at it yourselves…

                    <p>
                        ” Life is difficult… This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult – once we truly understand and accept it – then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters”
