                      Books have a very interesting power to make you think and even change the way you think. Its power to transform us at a much deeper level has always amazed me.

                      There have been several phases in my life with respect to books. Over the years, I traversed through the phases of Balarama’s, Amar Chithra Katha’s, Secret Seven, Famous Five, Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, Asterix & Obelix, Tintin, Harold Robbins (only the saucy pages I must confess ;) ), John Grisham, attempts at trying to read Kotler and the likes for a brief phase in between and the legendary Calvin n Hobbes (in that order)

                    <p>
                      And then sometime soon after my graduation, I got hooked to the non fiction bandwagon with the book Future Shift by Alvin Toffler. It’s been non fiction books for me ever since saving the few Chetan Bhagath books and the Bobanum Moliyum’s (I still adore this). I do realize that some people find non fiction books a tad boring but the good ones grip me as if im reading an engaging fiction piece.

                      I also did read the entire Diary of a Wimpy Kid series; my nephew is an absolute fan and hence I had bought a full set to gift him. Well, what can I say, I read one and ended up reading up the full pack.

                      The objective of this post is to share some of the book titles that have made a very profound impact on me, along with one key concept addressed in each book. In other words, this is my highly recommended list. These books made me rethink life.
                    </p>

                    <h2>1. Linchpin by Seth Godin</h2>

                    <p>
                      This book just asks you to be remarkable. There is a chapter in which he talks about the concept of a lizard brain and how do we tame it. Quite powerful.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>2. What got you here wont get you there by Marshall Goldsmith</h2>

                    <p>
                      This book is as much about unlearning, as much is it about relearning. It essentially talks about managing success and making the most out of it. It provides a very fresh and different perspective to how you go about things.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. The 4 hour work week by Tim Ferriss</h2>

                    <p>
                      I don’t think any book has impacted me so much as this one. This is the only book that I have re-read. Guess that says it all. His ruthless approach to hacking your lifestyle and methods to achieve insane levels productivity and effectiveness is simply awesome. Best part being that, he actually shows you how you can get it done with specific implementation and action steps
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. You can sell by Shiv Khera</h2>

                    <p>
                      For all those of you who are looking at selling anything, be it an insurance policy or yourself at a job interview, I would have to say this book is a gem. Simple, methodical and giving the strong message about the discipline and dedication that it takes to excel at selling and in life in general. To its credit, this book also details it out at an implementation level with specific examples
                    </p>

                    <h2>5. Im feeling lucky by Douglas Edwards</h2>

                    <p>
                      Quite honestly, I didn’t have any great hopes when I brought this book. But to my amazement, this book has been a revelation. Totally captures a whole new philosophy of how we approach work in the digital age aka the classic startup culture. Im feeling both dazed and amazed by the stories from the early days of Google detailed out in the book.

                      This post wont exactly be complete without a reference to few other books as well that deserve mentioning. These titles were also ones that really impacted me but since I forced myself to pick the top 5 for the post, I had to sort of leave them out. Here goes.

                      Maybe I’ll do follow up posts in which I summarize these books along with specific instances where I used the learnings / examples of how I brought about changes in my life based on that
